# Methodology

This section outlines the optimal control formulation and numerical approach.

## Problem setup (high-level)

- State: $ (x, y, \dot{x}, \dot{y}) $
- Control: $ (u_x, u_y) $ (thrust components)
- Dynamics:

$$
\dot{x} = \dot{x},\quad \dot{y} = \dot{y},\quad \ddot{x} = u_x,\quad \ddot{y} = u_y - g
$$

- Objective: weighted combination of control effort and terminal time/velocity
- Constraints: fixed initial state; terminal vertical position to ground; costate/Hamiltonian terminal conditions

## Numerical method

- Derive costate dynamics via Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle
- Solve two-point boundary value problem with SciPy `solve_bvp`
- Time normalization with parameterized final time
- Compute controls from costates

See `lunar.py` and `utils.py` for working implementations. Obstacle variants are in `multi_obstacle.py`.
