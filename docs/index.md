# Moonlander Optimal Control

Welcome! This project formulates and solves an optimal control problem for a 2D lunar lander using boundary value problem (BVP) techniques.

- Focus: minimum-time/effort landing, control and state constraints, and obstacle avoidance variants.
- Tech: Python (NumPy, SciPy solve_bvp), Matplotlib for plots/animations.

Get started:
- Install dependencies: see Quickstart
- Reproduce a baseline solution: see Quickstart
- Read about the math: see Methodology
- Browse visuals: see Results

Note: Large figures and videos may be added later under docs/assets.
