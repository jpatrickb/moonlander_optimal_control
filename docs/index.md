# Moonlander Optimal Control

This site highlights the scientific findings and methodology behind our optimal control study of a 2D lunar lander. The technical setup is available, but our emphasis here is on results and methods rather than how to run the code.

What youâ€™ll find first:
- Findings: concise takeaways and key results, with links to supporting figures.
- Methods: the mathematical formulation, assumptions, and numerical approach.
- Results: curated plots and visuals illustrating trajectories and controls.
- Authors: contributors credited as listed in the LaTeX sources.

If you do want to run the code, see Quickstart (bottom of the navigation).
